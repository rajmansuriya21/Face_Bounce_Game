# Face Bounce

## Overview
Face Bounce is an innovative browser-based game developed by WebOccult Technologies that uses face detection technology to control gameplay. Players move their face left and right to maneuver a paddle, preventing balls from falling off the screen while collecting power-ups and striving for high scores on the leaderboard.

## How It Works
1. The game uses your device's camera to track facial movements
2. Moving your face left or right controls the paddle position
3. Your goal is to keep the ball in play as long as possible
4. Collect power-ups to gain advantages
5. Beat your previous time and compete on the leaderboard
